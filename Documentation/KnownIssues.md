# Mindwave Unity - Known issues

## First check

1. Ensure the headset is turned on, with a battery in it.
2. Ensure [ThinkGear Connector](http://developer.neurosky.com/docs/doku.php?id=thinkgear_connector_tgc) app is running
3. Ensure you paired the Mindwave device with your computer (see [Installation guide for more infos](../README.md).

## Connection troubles

1. Turn off, and then turn on the headset, wait some seconds and retry
2. Check if the headset appears in the Bluetooth devices. If not, change the battery and retry
3. Quit ThinkGear Connector (totally, a process could still be running), then reopen it, and retry
4. Still not working ? Mh, things become complicated. May you should restart your computer (in doubt...)
5. ... I'm sorry for you :/
