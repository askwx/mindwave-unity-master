# Mindwave Unity

This is a Unity plugin for developping app and games with the *NeuroSky MindwaveMobile*, on the occasion of the [Serious Game Jam](https://www.eventbrite.fr/e/34697918408).

**Note**: This project is made with Unity 2017.2.0f3. The package works well on Unity 2017.x versions, but had not been tested on older versions.

## Installation

### 1. Pair the device

First, **pair the Mindwave headset** with you computer through **Bluetooth**. On Windows, go to Settings > Devices and click on "Add a Bluetooth or other device". In the popup, choose "Bluetooth", and wait for "MindwaveMobile" device to appear. Click on the device, and **pair it using the code `0000`**.

### 2. Install and run [ThinkGear Connector](http://developer.neurosky.com/docs/doku.php?id=thinkgear_connector_tgc)

Then, you need to **install [ThinkGear Connector](http://developer.neurosky.com/docs/doku.php?id=thinkgear_connector_tgc)**. It's a tool developped by NeuroSky that emit data from any of their device to a network socket. So it allows you to get data from the device, just like you get data from a website, using sockets.

### 3. Change the *API Compatibility Level*

* In your Unity Project, go to **Edit > Project Settings > Player**.
* Unfold the **Other Settings" section.
* Under **Configuration**, change the value of **Api Compatibility Level** to "**.NET 2.0**" (and not "**.NET 2..0 Subset**").

### 4. Start using plugin components

Back to the Unity plugin. You can find a folder `Package` at the project root. **Import that package** into your Unity project.

This package contains the classes and components of the plugin, a demo scene and a **"ready-to-use" prefab**.
